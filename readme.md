# WDI Emergency Compliment- Git-Teams-Solution (Angular)

## Missionâ€¦

Create your own version of [Emergency Compliment](http://emergencycompliment.com/) using Angular!

When a user visits the site, they should be greeted with a random compliment to cheer them up.

We are "faking" a back-end by using `data.js` for our compliments.

## Level 1: Generic Compliment

When you visit the root `http://localhost:8080/` it should display a randomly chosen compliment.
